Writeup for facial recognition project:
This project has been completed in colab environment.
Steps:
1. Import relevant libraries
numpy
tensorflow
matplotlib.pyplot
keras
scikit learn

2. load the data from npz file and find data heads

3. Split data into train and test classes

4. Normalize input training and test image data

5. One hot coding of output labels has beena ccomplished using scikit learn

6.The custom model has been built with 4 CNN layers and ANN 4 layers part with 20 classes

7. compiled the model with Categorical cross entorpy as a loss functiona nd adam as an optimizer

8. Train the model with GPU runtime with 20 btach size for training data and 32 default batch size for test data

9.plot the results

10. predict the output

11. verify the output
